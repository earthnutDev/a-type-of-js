- Removed the `isAtomics` method. Because `Atomics` is just a collection of methods, there are no instances. The same goes for `Math, JSON, Reflect, Intl`
- Removed the `isWindow` method.
- The `typeOf` method has been optimized to detect `asyncFunction`, `generator`, and `generatorFunction` more accurately
